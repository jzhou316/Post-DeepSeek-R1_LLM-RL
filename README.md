# DeepSeek-R1 Reproduction

#### [Simple Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason?tab=readme-ov-file#simple-reinforcement-learning-for-reasoning) (HKUST)


- Rule-based reward (no MCTS and reward models)
- Uses PPO rather than GRPO
- Trains small models (7B) on limited data (8K examples)
- Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B (base model), performs RL on it directly, achieving surprisingly strong results

#### [DeepScaleR](https://github.com/agentica-project/deepscaler/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#deepscaler) (Berkeley)

- Aimed to democratize reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs and reproduce DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1/O3 at scale
- Iteratively scaling Deepseek's GRPO algorithm from 8K→16K→24K context length for thinking
- Trained on top of [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) (_Joe: so the initial model is already capable of deep thinking; better if we can do from base models_)
- Good insight and training receipe: error cases are initially longer CoTs, so gradually extending context length for thinking during training (_Joe: a sort of curriculum learning for RL_)
