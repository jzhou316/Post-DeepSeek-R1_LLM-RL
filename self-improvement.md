- Majority voting to get rewards or replace external verify
- Model learning collapses to consistent but shortcut answers for long training

[(2025 May) Unsupervised Post-Training for Multi-Modal LLM Reasoning via GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22453)

- Very similar to above with majority voting rewards, but apply to multimodal models
